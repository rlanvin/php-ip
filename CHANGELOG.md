## [Unreleased]

### Backward Compatibility Breaking Changes

- Dropped support for PHP 7.0


## [3.0.0-rc2] - 2021-07-22

### Backward Compatibility Breaking Changes

- Separate "[private](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network)" from other "[reserved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_IP_addresses)" IP addresses.
This changes the behaviour of `IP::isPrivate()` and `IPBlock::getPrivateBlocks()` to be more narrow in scope.
The previous behaviour has been moved to new methods: `IP::isReserved()` and `IPBlock::getReservedBlocks()`.
- `IP::isPrivate()` renamed to `IP::isReserved()`
- `IPBlock::getPrivateBlocks()` renamed to `IPBlock::getReservedBlocks()`
- `IP::isPrivate()` now only tests if an IP is in a forwardable and non globally reachable IP Block as defined in the IANA special-purpose address registry
- `IPBlock::getPrivateBlocks()` now returns only the forwardable and non globally reachable IP Blocks as defined in the IANA special-purpose address registry


## [3.0.0-rc1] - 2021-04-18

### Backward Compatibility Breaking Changes

- Deprecated auto-detection of binary strings for IPv6 [#57](https://github.com/rlanvin/php-ip/pull/57)
This means you can't directly pass the result of `inet_pton` to construct an IPv6 instance anymore, because it is
impossible to reliability distinguish some IPv6 human-readable representation from their binary string representation.
Instead, you need to use the explicit factory method `IPv6::createFromBinaryString` if you want to work with `inet_pton`.
Note: this is still supported for IPv4.
- `IPBlock::getMask()` renamed to `IPBlock::getNetmask()`
- `IPBlock::getPrefix()` renamed to `IPBlock::getPrefixLength()`
- `IPBlock::getMaxPrefix()` renamed to `IPBlock::getMaxPrefixLength()`
- `IPBlock::getGivenIpWithPrefixLen()` renamed to `IPBlock::getGivenIpWithPrefixLength()`

### Added

- Support for PHP 8.0
- Added explicit factory methods for `IPv4`/`IPv6` classes:
`createFromInt`, `createFromFloat`, `createFromString`, `createFromBinaryString`, `createFromNumericString` and `createFromGmp`
- `IPBlock::plus()` and `IpBlock::minus()` now accept numeric strings and GMP instances
- `IPBlockIterator` now implements `ArrayAccess` which means you can write e.g. `IPBlock::create('192.168.0.0/24')->getSubBlocks('/25')[1]`
- New methods for `IPv4Block`/`IPv6Block`: `getPrivateBlocks()`, `getLoopbackBlock()`, `getLinkLocalBlock()`

### Changed

- Optimise performance of `IP::isPrivate()`

### Fixed

- `IPBlock::contains` now always throws an `InvalidArgumentException` if mixing IP versions

### Removed

- Removed deprecated method `IPBlock::getSuper`

## [2.1.0] - 2020-10-31

### Added

- New method `IP::matches($ip, $mask)` to perform wildcard mask matching common in network Access Control Lists and OSPF dynamic routing [#51](https://github.com/rlanvin/php-ip/pull/51)
- IPv4Block: Allow to specify the prefix also as an old-style netmask [#53](https://github.com/rlanvin/php-ip/pull/53)
- Support for PHP 7.4

## [2.0.0] - 2019-09-01

### Backward Compatibility Breaking Changes

- All classes now reside within `PhpIP` namespace. [#14](https://github.com/rlanvin/php-ip/pull/14)
- Deprecated `IPBlock::getSuper`, use `IPBlock::getSuperBlock()` instead. [#46](https://github.com/rlanvin/php-ip/pull/46)

### Added

- New method `isLoopback()` [#37](https://github.com/rlanvin/php-ip/pull/37)
- New method `isLinkLocal()` [#43](https://github.com/rlanvin/php-ip/pull/43)
- New method `reversePointer()` [#44](https://github.com/rlanvin/php-ip/pull/44)
- New method `IpBlock::getGivenIp` to return the IP used in the constructor [#6](https://github.com/rlanvin/php-ip/pull/6)

### Removed

- Drop support for PHP 5 [#8](https://github.com/rlanvin/php-ip/issues/8)

## [1.0.1] - 2015-06-26
